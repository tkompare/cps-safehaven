CPS's Safe Haven, Safe Summer loctator

In the Summer, Chicago Public Schools a collaborates with local churches to give CPS students to go over Summer that is filled with programs and activities. The program is called "Safe Haven, Safe Summer." It is free for CPS students, and serves free breakfast and lunch.

I've taken the data (see URL below), and created a simple web-based look-up tool to help families find Safe Haven locations nearby. Since parents need to register for Safe Haven at the church, and the published data did not have a way to contact the churches, I spent a few hours on Google yesterday to dig up the phone numbers for each church so parents can call to find out how to register. Well... okay. I only found 99 phone numbers out of the 100 churches in the program. There is one church that Google does not know about.

A big high-five goes to Alex Soble (formerly of CPS, onto different pastures) for locating the data, and to Tom Schenk (City of Chicago) for running the City's geolocator on the addresses on a Saturday. Thanks goes out to Smart Chicago Collaborative, especially, Chris Gansen, for setting up a place to host this thing in less than 24 hours ON A WEEKEND.
