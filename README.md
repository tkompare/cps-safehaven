=============

In the Summer, Chicago Public Schools a collaborates with local churches to give CPS students a place every day from July 1 to August 15 that is filled with enrichment programs and activities. The collaboration is called "Safe Haven, Safe Summer." It is free for CPS students, and serves free breakfast and lunch.

I've taken the data (see URL below), and created a simple web-based look-up tool to help families find Safe Haven locations nearby. Since parents need to register for Safe Haven at the church location, and the source web site did not include a phone number, I spent a few hours on Google digging up the phone numbers for each church so parents can call to find out more about the location and ask how to register. Well... okay. I only found 99 phone numbers out of the 100 churches in the program. There is one church that Google does not know about.

Big high-five goes to Alex Soble (formerly of CPS, onto different pastures) for locating the data, Tom Schenk (City of Chicago) for running the City's geolocator on the addresses on a Saturday, And also to Smart Chicago Collaborative, especially, Chris Gansen, for setting up a place to host this thing.
